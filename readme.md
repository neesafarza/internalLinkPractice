# Telescopic Practical Task

This folder contains all required files to run my submission for the practical task assigned. I hope you enjoy reviewing this as much as I enjoyed making it!

## Dependencies

- Any modern browser capable of running javascript (ideally google chrome)

## Usage

- Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice.
- You will start by viewing section (with the button also highlighted and url appended). 
- To view any section simply click on the navigation bar, or append the url with `#section{number}`. for example section 2 would be `../index.html#section2`
- The nav bar will highlight whatever section you are viewing, the url will also change depending on this.
